Each breakable stand is now synced with other players so multiple players cant rob the same stand for more loot.
fixed robbery status being synced i.e all clients can now rob a stand where as before only the owning client could
updated some variable names to english (for easier reading for myself and others going forward)
fix's on timer calcs but planning on switching this server side in the near future
fixed aninations going through the glass stands and placing of thermite (was really bugging me)
changed smoke colour (can change it back in the client script if you want the orange smoke)
updated the particles so they despawn, previously would stay there forever or until script restart
some other minor changes here and there

final thing, big shout out to AV for creating this script and releasing for free his discord is located here: https://discord.gg/aajBS9E9Er
